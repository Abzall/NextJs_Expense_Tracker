## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
* npm, yarn, or pnpm
* A NeonDB account and a database instance.
* A Clerk account and a project setup.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables. You'll get these values from your Clerk dashboard and NeonDB project settings.

    ```env
    # Clerk
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key

    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/

    # Prisma & NeonDB
    DATABASE_URL="your_neon_db_connection_string"

    # Optional: Add any other environment variables your application uses
    # NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
    ```
    *Make sure your NeonDB connection string is the one that works with Prisma (it usually ends with `?sslmode=require` or similar).*

4.  **Run Prisma migrations:**
    This will set up your database schema based on your `schema.prisma` file.
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    # or
    # npx prisma db push (if you prefer not to use migrations for initial setup, though migrate dev is recommended)
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or your configured port) with your browser to see the result.
